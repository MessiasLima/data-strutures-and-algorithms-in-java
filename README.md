# Data structures and algorithms in Java
Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia and Michael H. Goldwasser

I created this repository to store the examples of code that I developed while reading the book *"Data structures and algorithms in Java"*.
I divided the samples by chapters.

1. Java primer
    - [Hello Universe!](./src/examples/chapter1/hellouniverse/HelloUniverse.java)
    - exercises
        - reinforcements
            - [R-1.1](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/One.java)
            - [R-1.2](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Two.java)
            - [R-1.3](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Three.java)
            - [R-1.4](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Four.java)
            - [R-1.5](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Five.java)
            - [R-1.6](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Six.java)
            - [R-1.7](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Seven.java)
            - [R-1.8](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Eight.java)
            - [R-1.9](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Nine.java)
            - [R-1.10](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Ten.java)
            - [R-1.11](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Eleven.java)
            - [R-1.12](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/CreditCard.java)
            - [R-1.13](./src/examples/chapter1/exercises/reinforcement/Thirteen.java)
